  <h2>... and my new Astro site</h2>
  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    of my website, and it's the first one I built myself
  </p>
  <p>
    This site will be updated as I complete more of the tutorial, so I keep
    checking back and see how my journey is going
  </p>

  <p>Here are a few things about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {identity.country}</li>
    {
      identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
        <li>
          Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>
  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>

  {happy && <p>I'm happy to be learning Astro</p>}
  {finished && <p>I finished the tutorial</p>}
  {
    goal === 3 ? (
      <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>
    ) : (
      <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>
    )
  }
