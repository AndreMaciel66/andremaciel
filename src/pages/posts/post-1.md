# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2023-07-23

Welcome to my __new blog__ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making blog posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What is next

I will finish Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
