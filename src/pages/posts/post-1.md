Welcome to my __new blog__ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. __Installing Astro__: First I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. __Making pages__: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. __Making blog posts__: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What is next

I will finish Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
